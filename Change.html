<h1>Outline Of Change Action:</h1>
<!-- This Is the intro, should be somewhat of a mission statement-->

<p>This Document is intended to be an outline of what I want to change and the practical resources and steps to accomplish change.</p>

<dt>Brief:</dt>
<dd>There are so many areas in my life that I'd like to clean up and improve. One concept I am contantly stuggling with is <a href="combining-efforts.html">combining efforts</a></dd>

<h2>Core Dependencies</h2>

<li>Health</li>

	<li>Currently, I need to work on Discipline. Getting up early enough in the morning to exercise and eat a healthy breakfast before work. This will ensure consistency and that nothing can get in the way of the discipline.</li>
	<li>Proper sleep. This need some TLC, it doesn't just happen or rather some discipline could be applied. Dana mentioned that sometimes I am missing out on hang-out time, but I think with school starting it's probably better for eveyone to get into bed at a reasonable hour. I like staying up into the night if we are really into something as much as the next person, but I find there is little buffer to compensate. Like I will still have to get up and perform for work in the following days anyway so feels a little like burning the candle at both ends.
