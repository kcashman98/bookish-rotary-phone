<h1>Combining Efforts:</h1>
<!-- This should be a one line summary of what the page is for-->

<p>This Document intends to define the Concept of <dt>Combining Efforts</dt> </p>

<dt>Brief:</dt>
<dd>To Combine Efforts, I often think of how I can adapt or improve is I combine A with B. 
An example of this would be: I am trying to improve my life in general (A) and I will clarify, define and outline a plan of action to do that while writing it all up in HTML since I want to improve my understanding of web technologies (B)</dd>

	<li>Currently, I need to work on Discipline. Getting up early enough in the morning to exercise and eat a healthy breakfast before work. This will ensure consistency and that nothing can get in the way of the discipline.</li>
	<li>Proper sleep. This need some TLC, it doesn't just happen or rather some discipline could be applied. Dana mentioned that sometimes I am missing out on hang-out time, but I think with school starting it's probably better for eveyone to get into bed at a reasonable hour. I like staying up into the night if we are really into something as much as the next person, but I find there is little buffer to compensate. Like I will still have to get up and perform for work in the following days anyway so feels a little like burning the candle at both ends.
