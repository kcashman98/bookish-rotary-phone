	<li>Currently, I need to work on Discipline. Getting up early enough in the morning to exercise and eat a healthy breakfast before work. This will ensure consistency and that nothing can get in the way of the discipline.</li>
		<li>Proper sleep. This need some TLC, it doesn't just happen or rather some discipline could be applied. Dana mentioned that sometimes I am missing out on hang-out time, but I think with school starting it's probably better for eveyone to get into bed at a reasonable hour. I like staying up into the night if we are really into something as much as the next person, but I find there is little buffer to compensate. Like I will still have to get up and perform for work in the following days anyway so feels a little like burning the candle at both ends.
